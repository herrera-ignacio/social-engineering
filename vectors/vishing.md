# Vishing

Vishing or _voice phishing_ is the use of telephone to conduct phishing attacks.

> Landline telephone services have traditionally been trustworthy; terminated in physical locations known to the telephone company, and associated with a bill-payer.

It is easy, cheap, and very profitable for the attacker. It is also nearly impossible to locate and then catch the attacker with spoofed numbers calling from outside the country.

# Las Leyes de la Naturaleza Humana

> "If you come across any special trait of meanness or stupidty ... you must be careful not to let it annoy or distress you, but to look upon it merely as an addition to your knowledge - a new fact to be considered in studying the character of humanity. Your attitude towards it will be that of the mineralogist who stumbles upon a very characteristic specimen of a mineral." - Arthur Schopenhauer
